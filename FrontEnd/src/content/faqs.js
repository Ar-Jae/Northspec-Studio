    question: "Why is this more expensive than a normal website?",
    answer: "Because we don’t build “just websites.” We build systems — frontends, backends, integrations, and automation that actually run your business. Cheap builds cost more in the long run through breakdowns, rebuilds, and technical debt. We price for reliability, scalability, and long-term stability, not shortcuts."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge hourly or fixed price?",
    answer: "We price by scope and outcomes, not hours. Hourly encourages slow work, while scope pricing encourages efficient, high-quality delivery. You’ll always know your cost up front."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you do it cheaper?",
    answer: "If we reduced the price, we’d also have to reduce reliability, testing, support, and quality. We don’t compete on being the cheapest; we compete on being the team you don’t need to replace later."
  },
  {
    question: "Can’t we figure features out later?",
    answer: "No. “Figure it out later” turns into scope creep and blown timelines. We always define scope clearly first so your project stays predictable, stable, and successful."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don’t need automation yet?",
    answer: "Perfect. Automation (n8n) is completely optional. We build a strong frontend and reliable backend first, making automation compatible for when you’re ready. No forced upsells."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is automation priced separately?",
    answer: "Because automation isn’t a feature — it’s infrastructure. It requires deployment, security, monitoring, and reliability engineering. Separating it keeps pricing fair and expectations clear."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
    answer: "Yes — for larger projects. Typically 50% upfront and 50% before deployment. For bigger builds, milestone options (40/30/30) may be available. We do not do “pay after delivery.”"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own the code when it’s done?",
    answer: "Yes. Once the project is paid in full, you own your code, your system, and your data. We earn relationships by trust, not dependency."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of businesses is this NOT for?",
    answer: "We’re not the right fit if you’re looking for the cheapest option, a quick no-thinking website, unlimited revisions, or projects under $2,500. We work best with serious founders building real systems."
