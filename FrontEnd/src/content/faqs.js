    question: "What types of projects do you take on?",
    answer:
      "Marketing sites, product UI, internal tools, integrations, and performance/stability work. If it’s web-facing (or supports a web product), we can likely help."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can we start?",
    answer:
      "Typically within 1–2 weeks depending on scope. For urgent fixes or audits, we can often begin sooner."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with our designer or provide design?",
    answer:
      "Either works. We can build from your designs (Figma) or collaborate on structure, UX, and component styling using Tailwind best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "What does a typical engagement look like?",
    answer:
      "We start with a short discovery call, align on success metrics, then deliver in weekly milestones with transparent updates and demos."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you maintain and support an existing codebase?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We handle debugging, performance improvements, refactors, and ongoing maintenance, usually with a lightweight monthly support plan."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer fixed-price packages?",
    answer:
      "For well-defined scopes (like a landing page build), yes. For ongoing engineering support or complex integrations, time & materials is usually a better fit."
